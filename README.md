This is my first Github Tutorial - finally getting to know what Github is!!!!  YES!!!

Hello Earthlings!!

I am finally learning more about developing code so that I can understand more clearly what the applications teams are doing when we have conversation about their development. As my company is now moving from BitBucket to Github globally, I shuold at least understand what it is as I support the security of applciations being introduced into the environment. Cheers!!
